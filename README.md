# lgtv_remote

Yet another attempt at an LG smart TV remote control CLI. This an implementation of the [PyWebOSTV](https://github.com/supersaiyanmode/PyWebOSTV)
package which is the most complete and well written API interface in Python and, arguably, of any platform. 
Minimal docs will be provided eventually, however most instructions will be available as CLI help. Other API interfaces
and implementations are listed [here](https://github.com/vitalets/awesome-smart-tv#lg-webos).
